	(a)	Customer shall not use or authorize the use of the Program or any copy, portion, extract or derivative thereof with any Third Party Products or in any manner other than as expressly permitted herein.

	(b)	If the Program includes any Software designated by SiMa as pre-commercial Software (“Evaluation Software”), then Customer shall not place any such Evaluation Software into commercial use.

	(c)	Customer shall not copy any object code form of the Program except where such copy is created as an essential step in, and is necessitated by, or constitutes a back-up copy necessary for, the ordinary execution and running of the Program as expressly permitted hereunder. 

	(d)	Except as expressly permitted herein, Customer shall not, and shall not authorize any third party to, (i) alter, adapt, modify, translate, create derivative works of, (ii) subject to Section 3.3, decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer or attempt to derive the source code of, or any technical data, know-how, trade secrets, processes, techniques, specifications, protocols, methods, algorithms, interfaces, ideas, solutions, structures or other information embedded or used in, (iii) rent, lend, loan, lease, sell, distribute, or sublicense, (iv) remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary or restrictive notices affixed to or contained in, and (v) circumvent or attempt to circumvent any technological protective measure contained in or supported by, the Program or any copy, portion, extract or derivative thereof.

	(f)	The Program is licensed, as set forth herein, as a single product. Except as expressly permitted herein, Customer shall not separate the Program, nor use any component parts thereof other than as part of the Program as and in the form provided to Customer under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

	3.3.	Decompilation.  To the extent required by mandatory and non-waivable provisions of applicable law, Section 3.2 shall not preclude Customer from (a) reproducing software code within the Program and translating its form, provided that (i) such acts are performed by Customer and are indispensable to obtain the information necessary to achieve interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, (ii) the information necessary to achieve interoperability has not previously been readily available to Customer, (iii) Customer has requested in advance in writing that SiMa make such information available to Customer and SiMa has not done so within reasonable time, and (iv) these acts are confined to the parts of the software code within the Program which are necessary to achieve interoperability; and (b) observing, studying, or testing the functioning of the Program in order to determine the ideas and principles which underlie any element thereof, provided Customer does so in the ordinary execution and running of the Program as expressly permitted hereunder.  In no event may Customer (x) use any information obtained pursuant to subclause (a) of this Section 3.3 for any purpose other than to achieve the interoperability of the independently created computer program, (y) provide or disclose such information to others, except to the extent necessary for the interoperability of the independently created computer program, or (z) use such information in the development, production or marketing of a computer program substantially similar in its expression to the Program.  No license or right is granted hereunder, whether express, by implication, or otherwise, with respect to any information obtained pursuant to this Section 3.3 or its use.

	3.4.	SiMa Retained Rights. Customer agrees and acknowledges that SiMa (or its licensors, as applicable) owns and shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Program (including any copies, portions, extracts and derivatives thereof) and any and all intellectual property rights throughout the world relating thereto. Except for the rights expressly granted to Customer by SiMa herein under the Licensed Rights, and the Customer Modifications pursuant to Section 3.5, Customer does not acquire any rights in the Program, including any copies, portions, extracts and derivatives thereof, and Customer agrees and acknowledges that Customer does not and shall not have any other rights, whether by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, with respect to the Program or any intellectual property rights relating thereto.

	3.5.	Customer Modifications. Customer will own all right, title and interest in and to the Customer Modifications, subject to SiMa’s and its licensors’ retained rights in and to the underlying Program from which the Customer Modifications were derived. Customer may distribute the Customer Modifications to third party recipients, provided that Customer will (a) include in any Customer Modifications all copyright and other proprietary notices contained in the original copy of the underlying Program, and a copyright or other notice sufficient to provide notice of SiMa’s (or its licensor’s) intellectual property rights in and to such underlying Program, (b) not distribute any Customer Modifications derived from Evaluation Software for commercial use, and (c) not introduce or integrate any open source software into any Program without SiMa’s prior written consent. Customer will require any recipient of the Customer Modifications to comply with the foregoing, and will immediately notify SiMa of any breach (or suspected breach) of the same by any such recipient. Customer assumes all warranties and other obligations with respect to the Customer Modifications, and SiMa will have no responsibility or obligation (and will incur no liabilities) with respect thereto. Customer will not assert any rights in or to Customer Modifications against SiMa or any user of the Program or SiMa Hardware.

	3.6.	Program Activation. If the Program was provided subject to an activation or authorization procedure, or requires a validation key, Customer may not use the Program unless the Program has been properly activated or authorized, or such validation key has been properly obtained and applied, in accordance with the applicable procedures.  

	3.7.	Third Party Software. Customer agrees and acknowledges that (a) third party software (including open source software) may be incorporated, embedded or otherwise included in, or provided in connection with the Program, (b) additional or different terms and conditions may apply with respect to such third party software, and (c) use of such third party software is subject to such additional terms and conditions (“Third Party License Terms”) to which Customer hereby agrees.  A list or the text of any Third Party License Terms may be provided with the Documentation accompanying the Program (including any “help,” “about,” “readme” or similar files contained in the Program), or made available on SiMa’s website (currently at https://sima.ai/) or such other website as SiMa may designate from time to time. 

	4.	Paid Software or Services. 

	4.1.	Quotes and Orders. Customer may be required to purchase a license, validation key, or other authorization for the use of certain Software or for access to certain Software Services (including certain updates or upgrades to the Software) (“Paid Software or Services”). In such case, SiMa may provide a written quote to Customer for the Paid Software or Services (“Quote”) that includes a description thereof (including, for example, technical information, required system environment and architecture, specifications, proposed delivery and performance schedules, license term, and service term) and any proposed fees for the Paid Software or Services (“Fees”). All Quotes are non-binding and are subject to, and incorporate by reference, this Agreement. Following receipt of the Quote, Customer may issue to SiMa a written order to license or obtain the applicable Paid Software or Services (“Order”). All Orders shall (a) be consistent with, and indicate the date and identification number of, the Quote, (b) be subject to this Agreement, (c) not contain or be subject to any terms or conditions that are different from, inconsistent with, or in addition to this Agreement and the terms of any applicable Quote, and (d) be signed by an authorized representative of Customer. All Orders shall be firm and non-cancelable. SiMa shall be under no obligation to accept any Order, and no Order will be binding on SiMa until accepted by SiMa as follows: if SiMa accepts the Order, then SiMa will issue a written order confirmation (“Order Confirmation”) which shall be subject to, and incorporate by reference, this Agreement. Any requested change by Customer to an Order must be mutually agreed upon in writing by the Parties and may require a change in Fees reflecting the inclusion, deletion, or substitution of Paid Software or Services, as well as SiMa’s costs of processing such change.  SiMa reserves the right, at any time, to make alterations in design, form, functionality, and scope of the Paid Software or Services and to discontinue its offering of any Paid Software or Services. 

	4.2.	License Fees. No later than on the effective date of this Agreement or, if different, by the due date set forth in the applicable Order Confirmation, Customer shall pay to SiMa the applicable Fees.  Interest on any late payments shall accrue at the rate of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less. The Fees and all other charges hereunder do not include, and Customer shall be solely liable (and shall reimburse and indemnify SiMa) for, any taxes not based on SiMa’s net income (including, without limitation, any sales, use, value-added, withholding, property, excise, import or export tax), duties or tariffs imposed or levied by any governmental entity on the Paid Software or Services or in connection with this Agreement or the performance hereof.  All Fees shall be increased as may be necessary so that after Customer makes all deductions or withholdings that may be required by applicable law, SiMa receives an amount equal to the amount payable to SiMa hereunder without any such deductions or withholdings.

	5.	Software Services.  Subject to Customer’s payment of all applicable Fees to SiMa, SiMa shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Software Services to Customer in accordance with SiMa’s then-current service and support policy and SiMa’s then-current service and support terms (and subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement) or as otherwise agreed by SiMa and Customer in writing.

	6.	Confidentiality.  The Program and any copies, portions, extracts and derivatives thereof (including the source code of, or any technical data, know-how, trade secrets, processes, techniques, specifications, protocols, methods, algorithms, interfaces, ideas, solutions, structures or other information embedded or used in any of the foregoing) constitutes the confidential information of SiMa (“Confidential Information”).  Customer shall hold Confidential Information in strict confidence and shall not disclose it to any third party except to such employees of Customer who need to have access and who are bound in writing by confidentiality obligations at least as protective of the Confidential Information as those contained herein.  Customer shall not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than as necessary for Customer’s use of the Program as expressly authorized in this Agreement.  Customer shall exercise the same care that it exercises to protect its own confidential and proprietary information of similar importance (but in no event less than reasonable care) to avoid unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information. 

	7.	Disclaimer of Warranties. 

	7.1.	General Disclaimer. THE PROGRAM AND SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH CUSTOMER.  SIMA MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT OR RELATING TO THE PROGRAM, SOFTWARE SERVICES, OR THIS AGREEMENT.  SIMA HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ALL WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer agrees and acknowledges that there is no warranty or assurance that the Program will be free from defects or errors, or operate or perform without failure or interruption, and that there is no warranty or assurance that any defects or errors, or any failure or interruption in operation or performance will be corrected. 

	7.2.	High-Risk Uses. Customer acknowledges that the Program is not fault tolerant, nor designed, manufactured, or intended for use in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance (including, without limitation, the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons systems) in which failure of the Program could lead directly or indirectly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. Without limiting the generality of Section 7.1, SiMa and its licensors shall have no liability arising from use of the Program in any high-risk situations.

	8.	Limitation of Liability.  

	8.1.	Indirect Damages. Subject to Section 8.3, in no event shall SiMa (including its officers, directors, employees, agents and other representatives) be liable to Customer (including any other entity or person related to or affiliated with Customer) for any incidental, consequential, indirect, special or punitive damages whatsoever, or for any lost profits or revenue, lost business opportunities, lost or inaccessible data or information, or other pecuniary loss, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the subject matter hereof, whether liability is asserted in contract or tort (including negligence or strict product liability) or otherwise, and irrespective of whether SiMa (including its officers, directors, employees, agents and other representatives) has been advised of the possibility of any such damage or loss.

	8.2.	Liability Cap. Subject to Section 8.3, in no event shall SiMa’s (including its officers, directors, employees and agents and its suppliers) aggregate liability under or arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the subject matter hereof exceed the greater of (a) ten dollars ($10.00) and (b) the Fees (if any) paid by Customer to SiMa hereunder for the license of the applicable Program.  Customer acknowledges that the pricing of the Program and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement reflect the allocation of risk set forth in this Agreement and that SiMa would not enter into this Agreement without these limitations of its liability. 

	8.3.	Exclusions. The limitations of liability in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 do not apply to the extent liability cannot be contractually limited or disclaimed under applicable laws, with respect to bodily injury, and to the extent such damage or loss is the result of SiMa’s willful misconduct or gross negligence. 

	9.	Term and Termination

	9.2.	Termination. This Agreement shall immediately terminate if Customer breaches this Agreement, including, without limitation, any failure to pay Fees when due or any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Program or any copy, portion, extract or derivative thereof or of any other Confidential Information.  Programs that include any time-out or similar mechanism, or that have been validated for a limited time, shall be deemed to be provided for the time period until such time-out or similar mechanism has been set to become effective by SiMa, or such validation time period has expired, and this Agreement shall immediately terminate upon expiration of such time period. SiMa may also terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Customer if Customer (a) files for or becomes subject to any proceedings under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws, or initiates any action under any such laws for bankruptcy, reorganization, or liquidation, (b) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, (c) fails to generally pay its debts as they become due, or (d) dissolves or fails or ceases to continue business in the ordinary course.

Customer’s use of the Program may result in the generation of certain information and data, which may include information concerning or specific to Customer’s use of the Program (collectively “Customer-Generated Materials”). Customer hereby grants and agrees to grant SiMa access to such Customer-Generated Materials and any Customer Modifications, and a license to use, process, transfer and otherwise exploit any Customer-Generated Materials and Customer Modifications as may be reasonably necessary for SiMa to provide the Program or Software Services, or verify that Customer’s use of the Program is in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
